The Magic Power of Four

At VIIT College, the students at the "Number Crunch Café" were buzzing with excitement as they faced the challenge of identifying the magic powers of four. This time, the puzzle became a bit more challenging. The professor gave them a batch of test cases, and each test case contained multiple numbers to check if they were a power of four.

Each student was given a set of n numbers. For each number, they had to determine if it was a power of four.

The rules remained simple:

A number is a power of four if there exists an integer x such that:

𝑛 = 4^𝑥
 
For example:

4^0 = 1
4^1 = 4


Input:

First line: An integer n, denoting the number of test cases.

For each test case:

First line: An integer m, the number of numbers in that test case.

Second line: m integers to check if they are powers of four.

Output:

For each test case, output the results for each number in the list (either true or false).
