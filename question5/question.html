<p><strong>The Friendship Bracelet â€“ Finding Common Gems</strong></p>
<p>At VIIT College, a group of friends had a hobby of collecting unique friendship bracelets. 
    Each bracelet was decorated with several beautiful gems. 
     The goal was to find gems that were shared by two friends.

    They wanted to find the gems that appeared in both their collections, but only the unique ones.
    
    To do so, Alex and Bella decided to create an array for each of their collections of gems. The challenge was simple: Find the common gems between the two arrays and create a new array that holds only those common gems, with no duplicates.</p>
<p>Input Format:
<br>
First line: Two integers representing the lengths of arrays nums1 and nums2. <br>
Second line: The array nums1 of integers. <br>
Third line: The array nums2 of integers.</p>

<p>Output Format:
<br>
The output will be an array containing the unique common elements between nums1 and nums2.</p>
