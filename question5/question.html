<p><strong>Ram's Chocolate Hunt</strong></p>
<p>Ram is a student who loves chocolates, and the college canteen has a wide variety of them. Over the last few weeks, Ram has bought chocolates repeatedly, and he keeps a list of which chocolates he bought and how many times he bought each one. Every chocolate is represented by a number that uniquely identifies it.

    Now, Ram is curious to find out which chocolate is his "favourite"—the one he has bought the most number of times. If there is more than one chocolate with the same highest count, she considers all of them as her favorite chocolates.
    
    Can you help Ram determine how many different chocolates can be considered his "favourites"?</p>
<p>Input Format:
<br>
    The first line contains an integer N, denoting the number of times Ram bought chocolates.
    The second line contains 𝑁 integers, where each integer represents the ID of a chocolate bought by Ram.</p>

<p>Output Format:
<br>
    Output a single integer, representing the count of "favorite chocolates" (the chocolates that were bought the maximum number of times).
