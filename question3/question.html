<p><strong>The Number Crunch Cafe</strong></p>
<p>In the campus of VIIT College, there was a popular student spot called "The Number Crunch Cafe". Every week, the cafe held a fun contest for students to solve a unique puzzle. This week's puzzle was all about finding the perfect subarray.

    The cafe had a list of numbers that represented the daily sales of coffee cups. The challenge was simple: find a continuous subarray of these sales numbers such that the sum of the numbers in that subarray is equal to a given target sum.
    </p>
<p>Input Format:
<br>
The first line of input contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5), the number of days.<br>
The second line contains n integers representing the sales numbers for each day.</p>

<p>Output Format:
<br>
Print the starting and ending indices (1-based) of the subarray that sums up to the target. <br>
If no such subarray exists, print -1.</p>
