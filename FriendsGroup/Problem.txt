Secret Code Validation

There is a group of friends who communicate using a secret code. The secret code consists of a string of digits, where each digit represents an important message. However, there is a specific rule to determine if the message is valid or not.

The message is considered "Valid" if the sum of the digits at even indices is equal to the sum of the digits at odd indices. For example, if a message string is 12345, the sum of the digits at even indices (0-based index) would be 1 + 3 + 5, and the sum of the digits at odd indices would be 2 + 4. If these two sums are equal, the message is considered valid.

Your task is to check if the given message (a string of digits) follows this rule. If it does, print "message is valid". Otherwise, print "message is not valid".

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer N, denoting the length of the string.
The second line contains a string num consisting of digits. The length of the string will not exceed 


Output Format:
Print "message is valid" if the message is valid, otherwise print "message is not valid".
