In the campus of VIIT College, there was a popular student spot called "The Number Crunch Cafe". Every week, the cafe held a fun contest for students to solve a unique puzzle. This week's puzzle was all about finding the perfect subarray.

The cafe had a list of numbers that represented the daily sales of coffee cups. The challenge was simple: find a continuous subarray of these sales numbers such that the sum of the numbers in that subarray is equal to a given target sum.

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5), the number of days.
The second line contains n integers representing the sales numbers for each day.

Output:

Print the starting and ending indices (1-based) of the subarray that sums up to the target.
If no such subarray exists, print -1.
