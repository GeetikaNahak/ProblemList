<p><strong>The Magic Power of Four</strong></p>
<p>
  At VIIT College, the students at the "Number Crunch Café" were buzzing with
  excitement as they faced the challenge of identifying the magic powers of
  four. This time, the puzzle became a bit more challenging. The professor gave
  them a batch of test cases, and each test case contained multiple numbers to
  check if they were a power of four. Each student was given a set of n numbers.
  For each number, they had to determine if it was a power of four.
</p>

<p>
  The rules remained simple: A number is a power of four if there exists an
  integer x such that: 𝑛 = 4^𝑥
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>For example:
    4^0 = 1
    4^1 = 4</code></pre>
<p>
  Input Format:
  <br />
  First line: An integer n, denoting the number of test cases.
<br>
For each test case:
<br>
First line: An integer m, the number of numbers in that test case.
<br>
Second line: m integers to check if they are powers of four.
<br>
</p>

<p>
  Output Format:
  <br />
  For each test case, output the results for each number in the list (either true or false).
